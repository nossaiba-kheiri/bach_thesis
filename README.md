# Index Concentration and the Rich-Get-Richer Phenomenon using Reinforced Urn Processes   

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains the research, code, and documentation for my **Bachelor Thesis** at **Ã‰cole Polytechnique & University of California, Berkeley** under the supervision of **Prof. Lisa Goldberg**. The study explores **index concentration in financial markets** using **reinforced urn processes and power law models** to analyze the "rich-get-richer" effect in stock market indexes.

## ðŸ“– Thesis Summary  
This research investigates the **concentration of financial indexes**, particularly the **S&P 500**, through **stochastic modeling**. The study builds on prior work in **network science and probability theory** to analyze the dynamics of **market cap-weighted indexes**.  
Key methods explored include:  
- **Reinforced Urn Processes (RUP)** to simulate market dynamics.  
- **Power Law Distributions & Zipfâ€™s Law** for measuring concentration.  
- **BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert Model** for preferential attachment in financial markets.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulations** to compare model predictions with real-world index data.  

## ðŸ›  Code Documentation  
For a detailed breakdown of the code implementation, refer to **[description.html](https://github.com/nossaiba-kheiri/bach_thesis/blob/main/description.html)**.  
This file explains the **data processing, simulations, and models used** to replicate financial index behaviors.
