	doi = {10.1007/s11721-010-0041-9},
	abstract = {Faced with a choice of paths, an ant chooses a path with a higher concentration of pheromone. Subsequently, it drops pheromone
on the path chosen. The reinforcement of the pheromone-following behavior favors the selection of an initially discovered
path as the preferred path. This may cause a long path to emerge as the preferred path, were it discovered earlier than a
shorter path. However, the shortness of the shorter path offsets some of the pheromone accumulated on the initially discovered
longer path. In this paper, we model the trail formation behavior as a generalized Polya urn process. For k equal length paths, we give the distribution of pheromone at any time and highlight its sole dependence on the initial pheromone
concentrations on paths. Additionally, we propose a method to incorporate the lengths of paths in the urn process and derive
how the pheromone distribution alters on its inclusion. Analytically, we show that it is possible, under certain conditions,
to reverse the initial bias that may be present in favor of paths that were discovered prior to the discovery of more efficient
(shorter) paths. This addresses the Plasticity–Stability dilemma for ants, by laying out the conditions under which the system
will remain stable or become plastic and change the path. Finally, we validate our analysis and results using simulations.},

The process is defined for modelling-dependent random probabilities and has beta marginal distributions. We use this process to define a probability model for a family of unknown distributions indexed by covariates. The marginal model for each distribution is a Polya tree prior. An important feature of the proposed prior is the easy centring of the nonparametric model around any parametric regression model. We use the model to implement nonparametric inference for survival distributions. The nonparametric model that we introduce can be adopted to extend the support of prior distributions for parametric regression models.},

	abstract = {In matrix theory, the Perron–Frobenius theorem, proved by Oskar Perron (1907) and Georg Frobenius (1912), asserts that a real square matrix with positive entries has a unique largest real eigenvalue and that the corresponding eigenvector can be chosen to have strictly positive components, and also asserts a similar statement for certain classes of nonnegative matrices. This theorem has important applications to probability theory (ergodicity of Markov chains); to the theory of dynamical systems (subshifts of finite type); to economics (Okishio's theorem, Hawkins–Simon condition);
to demography (Leslie population age distribution model); 
to social networks (DeGroot learning process); to  Internet search engines (PageRank); and even to ranking of football
teams. The first to discuss the ordering of players within tournaments using Perron–Frobenius eigenvectors is Edmund Landau.},

	abstract = {When are we locked in a path? This is one of the main questions concerning path dependency. Coming from Arthur{\textbackslash}'s model of increasing returns and technology adoption (Arthur 1989), this paper addresses the question of when and how a lock-in occurs. To gain a better understanding of the path process, different modifications are made. First, the random selection of two types of adopters is substituted with a random selection of adopters having a Gaussian distributed natural inclination. Second, Arthur{\textbackslash}'s model shows only indirect network effects, so direct network effects are added to the model. Furthermore, it is shown that there is an asymptotic lock-in function referring to the technology A and B adopter ratio; this ratio is calculated within the process on the basis of a returning probability to an open state. In the following, the developed model is used to simulate path process without increasing returns, with increasing returns stopping when a lock-in occurs, as well as random drop-outs of increasing returns. One answer that could be drawn out of this new extended model is that there is no lock-in without further stabilizing returns. This and other aspects are used to provide a simplified path-model for empirical research. Finally, its limits are discussed in regard to uncertainty, innovation, and changes in network effect parameters.},
